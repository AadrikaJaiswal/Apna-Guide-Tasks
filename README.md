# Apna-Guide-Tasks
This is the Task repository containing the work I've done during my internship at Apna Guide.

This repository contains two Machine Learning tasks, The 'Customer Churn Prediction Model' and the 'Disaster or Not Disaster Model' and their respective CSV files-- the Churn-Data of the former and the test, train, and submission CSV files of the latter.
