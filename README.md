# Apna-Guide-Tasks
This is the Task repository that contains the work I've done during my internship period at Apna Guide.

This repository contains two Machine Learning tasks, The 'Customer Churn Prediction Model' and the 'Disaster or Not Disaster Model' and there respective CSV files-- the Churn-Data of the former and the test, train and submission CSV files of the latter.

As I'm not very well aquainted with using GitHub, I couldn't put these two tasks in separate subrepositories but will do that later after creating their separate subrepositories.
